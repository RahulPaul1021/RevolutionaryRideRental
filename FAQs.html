        <p>No, when you purchase a rental our live inventory systems strictly reseve that bike model and size for you for that duration. That means no other person can start or end their trip during that time period. If you are unsure of your travel plans or the duration of rentalwe suggest starting with the amount of time you are comfortable with. If you wish to extend your multi-day rental please call us and we will confirm the rate and availability. Availability and rate are only guaranteed when you have reserved and paid for your rental in full.</p>

        </div>
        <p>A 24 Hr rental is exactly that; the  bike is due back 24 hrs from the time you reserved the bike. For example, if you reserved the bike at 12:00 pm it is due back by 12:00 pm the next day 3-day and weekly rentals are due back on the last day by close unless otherwise stated.For example, for a 3-day rental, if you pick up the bike on Monday at 10:00 it will be due back by Wednesday before the store's close time, 6:00pm. If you rented the bike for one week, it would be due back on the seventh day by the store's close time, in the case that you picked-up on Monday it would be due back Sunday by the store's closing time. If you are not able to return the bike on the agreed-upon date and time please let us know as soon as possible. There will be a ₹147.62 penalty for each day it is not returned.</p>
